# 🌱 Invisible Wallets  
### Redefining Finance Through Community & Reputation

Invisible Wallets is a privacy‑first, document‑light digital wallet designed for people who are excluded from traditional banking systems due to lack of formal identity documents.

Instead of relying on government-issued IDs, the system enables users to **build a financial identity through community trust and transaction reputation**.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Millions of migrant workers, daily‑wage earners, homeless individuals, and informal workers are unable to access digital financial services because they lack formal identity documents required for bank accounts and KYC-based systems.

This exclusion prevents them from:
- Receiving salaries digitally  
- Sending or storing money safely  
- Building any form of financial history  

---

## 💡 Solution

**Invisible Wallets** introduces an alternative financial identity system where:

- Users create a digital wallet without traditional KYC  
- Trusted community members verify users  
- A blockchain-based reputation score grows over time through transactions  
- Financial access is earned through behavior, not paperwork  

This redefines *who finance is for*, not just how it works.
